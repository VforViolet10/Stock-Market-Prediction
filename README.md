# TrendFlow: Data Science & AI-Powered Stock Price Prediction

**TrendFlow** is an AI-driven platform that leverages **Data Science** and **Deep Learning** to forecast stock prices with high accuracy.
By analyzing **historical stock data**, **market trends**, and **news sentiment**, TrendFlow empowers traders and investors to make intelligent, data-backed financial decisions.

---

## Overview

Stock markets are inherently volatile and unpredictable.
TrendFlow aims to bridge the gap between **data** and **decision-making** by combining:

* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **Transformer** models for sequential trend prediction
* **Sentiment analysis** of financial news and social media
* **Real-time data pipelines** for continuous learning and forecasting

This project is designed to help retail and institutional investors, algorithmic traders, and financial analysts gain insights into market trends and price movements.

---

## Objectives

* Develop a **deep learning–based stock price prediction model**.
* Analyze **historical market data** and identify meaningful patterns.
* Integrate **LSTM** and **Transformer** architectures for high accuracy.
* Deliver **real-time insights and forecasts** to users.
* Provide a **user-friendly web or mobile interface** for stock predictions.

---

## Research Gap

Existing prediction systems often focus only on technical indicators or static data.
TrendFlow improves upon these by:

* Combining **technical** + **sentiment-based** analysis.
* Handling **non-linear patterns** better than traditional ARIMA models.
* Providing **real-time adaptability** with continuous data updates.
* Incorporating **external macroeconomic and news-based factors**.

---

## Tech Stack

### **Programming & Frameworks**

* **Python** (Core Language)
* **TensorFlow / Keras**, **PyTorch** (Deep Learning Frameworks)
* **StatsModels**, **Prophet**, **ARIMA** (Time Series Analysis)
* **NLTK**, **HuggingFace Transformers** (NLP and Sentiment Analysis)

### **Database & Backend**

* **PostgreSQL**, **Firebase**, or **MongoDB** for data storage
* **Flask**, **FastAPI**, or **Django** for backend APIs

### **Frontend & Visualization**

* **React.js** (Web UI) / **Flutter** (Mobile App)
* **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, or **Tableau** for dashboards and analytics
